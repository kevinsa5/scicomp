# scicomp

Frequently I find myself opening an R or Julia session to generate some test data, do a quick calculation, or plot something.  This is designed to be an in-browser computation language that satisfies that need.

The code is inspired by Mihai Bazon's lisperator, Peter Norvig's lispy, and Marijn Haverbeke's parse-js.
